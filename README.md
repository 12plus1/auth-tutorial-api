# Vapor backend part of OAuth2 with ORY Hydra, Vapor 3 and iOSÂ 12 tutorial series
We have written a [tutorial series](https://medium.com/12plus1) in which we try to give you a broad understanding on how to implement the OAuth2 authorization code flow with an iOS app, a Vapor API and Hydra as the OAuth2 server.

This repository contains the code for the Vapor backend that gets implemented in [Part 2](https://medium.com/@12plus1co/oauth2-implementation-with-ory-hydra-vapor-3-and-ios-12-82261ad6dfd2) and [Part 3](https://medium.com/@12plus1co/oauth2-implementation-with-ory-hydra-vapor-3-and-ios-12-97c2d944c53c) of the tutorial series.
